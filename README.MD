# Soondex Protocol

Soondex is a decentralized liquidity pool protocol built on the Solana blockchain, enabling users to create liquidity pools, swap tokens, provide liquidity, and stake their assets for rewards. This README provides an overview of the implementation, features, and components of the Soondex protocol.

## Features

- **Liquidity Pools**: Create and manage liquidity pools for token pairs.
- **Token Swapping**: Swap tokens with automated market-making functionality.
- **Liquidity Provisioning**: Add and remove liquidity to/from pools.
- **Staking**: Stake LP tokens to earn rewards.
- **Admin Management**: Manage pool administrators.
- **Reward Claiming**: Claim rewards based on staking.

## Implementation

### Prerequisites

- Rust programming language
- Solana CLI
- Anchor framework
